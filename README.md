# Predicting Late Delivery Risk in Supply Chain Management

## Overview
Efficient supply chain management is crucial for maintaining operational effectiveness, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage in any business. One of the key challenges in supply chain management is the risk of late deliveries, which can disrupt production schedules, increase costs, and damage customer relationships. Accurately predicting the risk of late deliveries enables businesses to take proactive measures, mitigate potential delays, and ensure timely fulfillment of orders.

This project aims to develop a robust and reliable predictive model that can accurately identify orders at high risk of being delivered late.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model to identify the risk of late deliveries in the supply chain.
- Analyze various factors from the dataset to help supply chain managers anticipate delays.
- Create a web interface to interact with the predictive model.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains various attributes related to the supply chain, including order details, shipping information, supplier performance, transportation logistics, and more. The target variable is `late_delivery_risk`, which indicates whether a delivery was late or on time.
